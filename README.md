# Train-Scheduler

### What the project does

This app allows the user to add a train to the train schedule. The user will include the name of the train, the train's destination, how frequent the train runs, and when the first train arrives. The app then users that information to display the name, destination, and frequency of the train, as well as the next arrival and how many minutes away the train is. 

### Why the project is useful

This is a great project for those who utilze public transportation, particularly trains, and allows the user to have a quick and easy reference for when their favorite trains run. 

As a developer, this is a great assignment for learning how databases work, how data is sent to the database, and how it is displayed as HTML when it is called from the database. 


### How users can get started with the project

Users can start by adding a train in the "add train" section. Once they click submit, the input data is sent to a database (firebase) which then is displayed as HTML in the scheduler above the "add train" section.
